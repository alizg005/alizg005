### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning C# in my free time, before the cohort starts. I am looking to collaborate and get help anything C# related topic. :) Ask me about anything, but expecially about my dog, backpacking and boardgaming. I can talk hours about these topics. You can reach me on FB, slack or by phone. 
I am originally from Hungary, moved to the states 6 years ago. When I was 17 I lived in Japan for a year. Love learning new languages, and personal growth is a big part of my life. 
My pronounce is she/her.
